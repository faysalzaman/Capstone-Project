    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
    
    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
    <p>My capstone project is a web application that helps people find the best restaurants in their area. I am building it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also using the Google Maps API to display the locations of the restaurants.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Website</h2>
    <p>I built a personal website to showcase my projects and skills. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it. I also used the Bootstrap framework to make it responsive.</p>
    
    <h2>Mobile App</h2>
    <p>I built a mobile app that helps people track their fitness goals. I used React Native to build it. I also used the Firebase database to store the user's data.</p>
